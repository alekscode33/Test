## Hello world!

Teftelka is pretty cute cat! :)

Yep, that's absolutely correct !!! :)
Good Luck with your github !

1. Created an account on GitHub.com
2. Created a local repository
3. Connected local and remote repositories (repo). When creating a repository on GitHub, you will be given some instructions on how to do this.
4. Once connected Run `git push` via VSC terminal - push latest changes from local repository to remote GitHub repository.
5. After making any changes to the created remote repository directly through GitHub or being uploaded to the repository from another computer on GitHub, you will need to download the current current version using `git pull`.
