# Instructions how to clone repository from [GitHub.com](http://GitHub.com) to your local folder to work with

1. Need to create an account on [GitHub.com](http://github.com/) if we donâ€™t have.
2. Find and open required repository which we are going to copy  and click on the green button to copy the github-link for instance: 
[`https://github.com/ilnar-geekbrains/version_control_lection_3.git`](https://github.com/ilnar-geekbrains/version_control_lection_3.git)
3. Create or choose a folder on your computer to create local repository. 
4. We need to open selected folder in Visual Studio Code (VSC) terminal. Firstly make sure that is not a repository with the command  `git status` . If we see the fatal error that it is OK, otherwise the directory is already a repository and we should chose other place or delete .git folder to remove repository.
5.  After that we need to copy repo from GitHub to your local folder with command in VSC terminal  
`git clone https://github.com/ilnar-geekbrains/version_control_lection_3.git`
6. Git will download the selected repository on gitHub to our folder as a folder with the same name.
7. In the VSC terminal, to work with cloned repository need to change the folder and enter the selected repo which we recently downloaded using the command 
`cd version_control_lection_3.git` and that it we can to start to work with files.
8. It is our copy of repository and it is not connected to GitHub.com
